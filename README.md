# Readme-Generator

## Description 
This Challenge we were asked to make a readme generator. This project prompts the user to answer questions about their project and and after a professional and clean readme is generated.

## Installation
While creating this project the first part I started on was the index.js style, I made sure the proper files and packages were at the top of the page, next I moved on to generate the questions that needed to be asked so all the requirements were met and ever section could be properly answered. Next I wrote the function that wrote the readme file once the data was collected and console log the success of making the file, if the data could not be collected it would show an error. Then I wrote the init function that prompt the user with the questions and took that information the th user give and if successful creates the readmefile, if not successful give an error. Lastly I worked on the generateMarkdown.js file first thing I did was finish the function to generate the badge, link and license section, lastly I wrote the generateMarkdown function that that took the data from the the questions asked and put them in the correct readme section in a readme outline created along with the license badge and github link.

## Usage 
When users run the index.js file they are prompted with questions on the title, description, installation, usage, contribution, tests, github url, email, and a list to choose what license was used. Once user fills out all the information a new readme file is generated, when they open the preview they are presented with all the correct section a license badge and url to their github.
